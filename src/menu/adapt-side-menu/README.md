Menu choices are framed within a box element and arranged in a grid and placed on half side of window. **Side Menu** allows you to direct the learner to either further menus (sub menus) or to one or more pages of content. The **Side Menu** default is show a title, an image, some body text, duration, a progress indicator and a link button.

Options include an estimated time for completion (duration) and a progress bar to indicate the percentage of components that have been completed.

### Accessibility
Several menu-related elements are assigned a label using the [aria-label](https://github.com/aniketdharia/adapt_framework/wiki/Aria-Labels) attribute: **ariaRegion**, **menuItem**, and **menuEnd**. These labels are not visible elements. They are utilized by assistive technology such as screen readers. Should the label texts need to be customised, they can be found within the **globals** object in [*properties.schema*](https://github.com/aniketdharia/adapt-side-menu/blob/master/properties.schema).
